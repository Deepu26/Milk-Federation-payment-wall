The milk and its products are considered to be the wholesome food, hence its consumption is being increased and included as the part of routine life. 

So, we are developing the application which helps the users in better and easy way.
Here the user need not move to the dairy to purchase the milk products and will get the instant delivery service of products to the desired location with additional facility of online payment.

In the existing system, the user has to move to the dairy to purchase the milk or milk
products and there is no facility for online payment.

So, providing information and making payment through online to the customers plays a vital role in this fields. 

In the virtue of this, we are developing the application which helps the users in better and easy way.

This project is specially designed keeping in mind the problems faced by people in daily routine. It is user friendly to use with extra features for emergency situations. It is cost effective if compared, hence making it feasible for a large population.

online service for the milk products.
